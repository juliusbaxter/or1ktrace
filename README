				or1ktrace
				=========

About:
======
This is a library intended to be used by OpenRISC 1000 simulation models to 
generate execution traces.

It doesn't fully work yet.

It's handy because you don't have to write a disassembler in every single
model you have - just link to this guy and generate consistent traces across
all models, which makes them easy to debug and compare.

That's the idea, anyway.

TODO:
=====

 * Plumb it into or1ksim for starters, and check the full trace line works.
   Next try to get it into Verilog and cycle accurate RTL models.
 * Double check whether all the callbacks are really needed.
 * Maybe add a binary trace option where we sort out a data structure that 
   can be dumped to a file for greater speed. This would also involve somehow
   decoding the function back into trace lines.
